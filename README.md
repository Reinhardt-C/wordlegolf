A repository containing my attempts at finding upper bounds for the [Kolmogorov Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity) (in JavaScript) of the Wordle word set, by golfing a script which outputs each word line by line.
See [Golf Horse](http://golf.horse/wordle/) for more info, specifications, and other peoples' solutions..
